Stockmarket Trading Database Management System

Mission Statement:

To build and maintain a database for an online stock trading platform. The platform allows to keep track of companies and the stocks they have available to trade. It should also allow traders to register and trade the stocks of these companies.

The potential customers of this system are
- people who want to trade and manage their portfolios
- companies who want to list their stocks

Companies can list their stocks by providing the details of the stocks they want to trade to the platform's administrator. They can then track how their stocks are performing by checking the lowest and highest prices, trading volumes, and other data.

Traders can log in to the platform and place orders to buy and sell stocks. They can also view their portfolios and trades. A portfolio is a collection of stocks that a trader owns. The platform should be able to support multiple trades happening at the same time, and there should be no limit on the number of trades a trader can make in a day.

This type of platform would make it easier for traders to buy and sell stocks of the companies they want, at their own convenience. It would also benefit companies by making it easier for them to reach a large number of traders and increase the value of their stocks.


Objectives:

1. The database will provide a user-friendly interface for companies and traders to manage their stock listings and portfolios.
2. The database will be able to handle transactions and queries without sacrificing performance or security.
3. The database should support different types of orders, such as market orders, limit orders, and stop-loss orders.
4. The database should be able to scale to accommodate future growth in the number of users and transactions. It should also be extensible to support new features and functionality.
5. The database must be protected from unauthorized access and modification, especially for sensitive data such as user account information and financial transactions.
